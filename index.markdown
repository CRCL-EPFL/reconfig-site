Re:Config explores new ways to adapt partially damaged or outdated timber structures by reconfiguring their spatial layouts and structural systems while preserving as much material as possible. The project introduces a hybrid workflow where humans and robots collaborate in processes of disassembly, repair, and reconstruction, navigating the uncertainties of material condition, ad-hoc tectonics, geometry, and other factors which cannot be accounted for a priori.

Beyond assisting with heavy and repetitive tasks, robots further support skilled workers in repairing and extending elements in situ, devising new techniques of digital craft rooted in artisanal timber framing and repair.

By integrating robotic fabrication, computer vision, structural design, and assistive decision-making, Re:Config enables localized, on-the-fly interventions that eliminate the need for extensive scaffolding, logistics, or full deconstruction. All operations follow design-for-disassembly (DfD) principles, aiming to preserve future reuse potential. As a new DfD logic is introduced into traditional interlocking frames, hybrid tectonics emerge; bridging traditional techniques with adaptive, forward-looking construction methods.

On-the-fly-Reuse

The structural elements of the existing building are relocated and reassembled to form a new configuration. This transformation occurs progressively—on the fly—as the structure evolves from a pitched roof with trusses to a flat roof with reinforced layers. This shift introduces a new typology, complete with updated construction details and architectural language. Each beam is surveyed and documented for length, diameter, density, and condition to assess its potential for reuse.
